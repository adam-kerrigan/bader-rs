### Changes
- Moving to allow python bindings by separating functions and making structs more streamlined.
- Switch the entire analysis section to functions rather than a struct.
- Threaded charge summing, assigning maxima to atoms and the new maxima finding function.
- Lots of moving around of functions and changing outcomes, i.e, to_cartesian now returns cartesian coordinates.
- Updated to Clap v3.
- Created a VoxelMap Trait.
### Features
- Added a nearest neighbour function.
